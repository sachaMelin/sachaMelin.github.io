                    Mr.T is a FPS (first person shooter) game that is set in a dystopian future. Mr.T is the president and is being attacked in the white house.
                    The player controlls either the body guard of the president Mr.T or the attackers. The player can only move around the map and shoot at the enemies.
                    The goal as a body guard is to kill all the attackers or to resist until the count down is over. The goal as an attacker is to kill the president or all the body guards.

                    <p>
                        After listing all our requirements, we created a git repository. The choice of the repository was convenient
                        of all git properties. The repository is a git repository that is hosted on GitLab.
                        And you will see that many issues will come with this solution.

                    <p>
                        The two first months were mainly about getting to know Unity and Blender. This is why our first draft wasn't that good. 
                        We had to create a prototype of the game with simple graphics because one part of our team was developing the assets from scratch
                        on Blender.

                    <h2>First issues with both multiplayer and AI</h2>
                    <p>
                        After this month, we manage to have a multiplayer and AI on our game. But we still have some issues with both. First the AI patrolling 
                        was struggling and the multiplayer was not synced with the map.

                    <h2>Starting to have a playable game</h2>
                    <p>
                        The game was playable. The player was able to move around the map and shoot at the enemies. Also, the multiplayer made great improvements. 
                        We were able to play with each other on a simple map. At that time we also, started to add all of our finished presets. 
                        And our first issue with git appeared. We had a storage space issue. The whole project was too big in term of storage space.
                        We manage to implement git LFS that allow us to store the big files, compressed.

                    <h2>Multiplayer done and big graphics improvement</h2>
                    <p>
                        We managed to have a multiplayer on the main map and a big graphics improvement. The player was no longer a capsule but a character with the design we wanted. 
                        We also managed to have a better AI patroling but an issue was still there. The AI somtimes, was shooting to the sky instead of on the player.
                        An elevator was also made to make the game more interesting because of the map design.
                        Finally, some OSTs were made. One for a battle ambiance, another one more chill for the menu and one for the elevator.

                    <h2>Fixing AI and animations added</h2>
                    <p>
                       The AI was fixed and animations were added. The animations were mainly for the character movement. It was nice to see a character moving instead of 
                       dead object flying around. The menu was also done with the music previously made. We could navigate through the menus and start both the solo and multiplayer mode with it.
                       The design of the game was more and more matching our vision.
